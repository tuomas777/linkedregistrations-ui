## Url parameters

There are some url parameters which can be used when using enrolment form in external service:

`iframe`:
e.g. https://linkedregistrations-ui.test.kuva.hel.ninja/fi/registration/22/enrolment/create?iframe=true

This parameter can be used to hide page header. Page header is hidden when iframe=true

`redirect_url`:
e.g. https://linkedregistrations-ui.test.kuva.hel.ninja/fi/registration/22/enrolment/create?redirect_url=https://www.google.com/

This parameter can be used to redirect user automatically to selected url after successful enrolment. It's important to include also protocol to the url.
